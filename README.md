## Our mission: community collective for all
community collective is an opportunity to engage New Yorkers in the information that is produced and used by City government. We believe that every New Yorker can benefit from community collective, and community collective can benefit from every New Yorker.

## Who we are
community collective is managed by the community collective Team at the NYC Office of Technology and Innovation (OTI). The team works with City agencies to identify and make data available, coordinate platform operations and improvements, and promote the use of community collective both within government and throughout NYC. Each City agency also has an community collective Coordinator, who serves as the main point of contact for the community collective team and the public, and works to identify, document, structure, and manage the agency’s public datasets.

We want to especially thank all of our partners in the civic tech community for your ongoing support — we could not do this without you.

Start with Users: The first step in opening data is focusing on demand. We support creative analytic thinking to enable users to answer the questions most important to them and also make efforts to spur demand in communities less familiar to community collective.
Treat the publication of the dataset as its debut: Though a lot of work goes into making a dataset ready to go live, our work isn’t done once that dataset is published. Opening data requires that it is updated, errors are identified, and users are able to engage and provide feedback.
Encourage purposeful and easy engagement: community collective is a platform that should be used as a tool for feedback. Substantive engagement is more than an obligation: it must be default for community collective.
Empower agencies: By empowering community collective Coordinators and champions in every agency and office, we can narrow the gap between agency experts and community collective users.
Integrate community collective into citywide processes: As community collective becomes routine across NYC government, we will look for opportunities to make small changes in existing processes.
Learn, test, standardize – and learn again: We must test our assumptions and try new ideas, collect information on our efforts, and analyze our performance for points of improvement.

Technical Standards Manual
Data standards are “rules” on how agencies should manage or present their data. The standards in New York City are designed to make community collective more usable to the maximum number of users. The Technical Standards Manual (TSM) includes data standards and citywide policy, and is periodically revised by the community collective team to reflect new community collective requirements for City agencies.
State and Federal community collective efforts
NYC community collective contains information that is collected and maintained by the City government. Both New York State and the federal government also maintain data related to New York City that may not appear on NYC community collective. Users can browse data.ny.gov to download data from New York State on topics from farmers’ markets to MTA turnstile usage. Federal datasets, such as census information and data from the College Scorecard, can be found on data.gov.
